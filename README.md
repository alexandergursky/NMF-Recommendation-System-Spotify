## How Spotify Uses Decomposition Algorithms for Song Recommendations
NMF is a dimensional reduction method and effective for document/feature clustering, because a term-document matrix is high-dimensional and sparse. 
The initial matrix of the NMF algorithm is regarded as a clustering result.

### How To Use
I have included the trained model for demonstration purposes, if you would like the raw data in order to follow along 
with my cleaning and wrangling process, please reach out to me and I would be glad to distribute that. 
To use it, open one of the 3 files listed below: <br>
- "Spotify_NMF_Final.ipynb"
- "NMF_Music_Artist_Recomend_Sys_R_Conversion.R"
- "nmf-quick-run.py" <br>
<br>
Then run the cell, line, or script which loads the model. Lastly select the artist of your choosing.
Please reach out for any further inquiries.
